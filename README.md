## Objectives

&lt;# cory

cory is an AI-powered choreography analysis tool that helps dancers and choreographers learn, practice, and refine routines.  

This MVP allows users to upload a dance video, automatically skeletonizes the dancer, and provides tools for leaving and receiving notes directly on the video.  

Key features include:
- **Auto-Naming of Dance Moves** – Detects and labels distinct choreography segments.
- **Flippable View** – Mirror-flip the video or skeleton for easier practice.
- **3D Model Rendering** – Visualize movement from multiple angles.
- **Music Sync** – Aligns the analyzed video with its soundtrack for beat-accurate playback.
- **Similarity Scoring** – Compares a practice video to the original and generates an accuracy score.
- **Learning Mode** – Breaks choreography into manageable sections for step-by-step practice.

cory aims to make learning choreography as interactive and data-driven as possible, bridging creativity and technology for dancers and instructors alike.

**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL · Python (FastAPI) · React
